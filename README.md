# NeverMindTheMolluscs

This is an attempt to pythonize the BASIC programs included with
[The Algorithmic Beauty of Sea Shells](https://doi.org/10.1007/978-3-662-03617-4) by
[Hans Meinhardt](https://www.eb.tuebingen.mpg.de/emeriti/hans-meinhardt).

Although an e-book is still [available from Springer](https://www.springer.com/gb/book/9783540921417), the simulations consisting of over 20K lines of BASIC code are not included with it. Second-hand copies including the original CD or even diskette can still be found.

Here, the activator-inhibitor diffusion simulations are implemented in vectorized Numpy.
